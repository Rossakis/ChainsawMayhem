# ChainsawMayhem

## About this project ##
Chainsaw Mayhem is a 2D action side scroller (Unity) game, that entails the story of Chainsaw Man, Tastuki Fujimoto's manga, retold through a sequence of pixel-styled bosses in the chronological order of the series.
It is made purely as a tribute to the highly acclaimed series and seeks to bring the joy of interacting with its world to the fans.

*Currently, it's at the start of its development, and will undergo many changes in the near future, so stay tuned*
